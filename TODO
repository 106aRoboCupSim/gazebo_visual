Welcome anyone to add somthing to this list or pick some items from it and contribute to this code.

1. Add a GUI to configure parameters, e.g. robot numbers, model path, etc. (medium)
2. Since rolling friction is not supported by ODE, manually adding force is added in nubot_gazebo.cc. However, it would be better to move this part to the model plugin of the soccer ball. (easy)
3. Add a physical simulation model for kicking mechanism.  (hard)
4. Add a physical simulation model for dribble mechanism.  (hard) 
5. show role labels beside each robot; show the positioning points; (medium)
6. improve detect_ball_out();    (easy)
7. set up a virtule runtime environment; refer to Matlab's support for RoboCup; (hard)
