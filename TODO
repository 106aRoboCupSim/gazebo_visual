Welcome anyone to add somthing to this list or pick some items from it and contribute to this code.

1. Add a GUI to configure parameters, e.g. robot numbers, model path, etc. (medium)
2. Add a physical simulation model for kicking mechanism.  (hard)
3. Add a physical simulation model for dribble mechanism.  (hard) 
4. show role labels beside each robot; show the positioning points; (medium)
5. set up a virtule runtime environment; refer to Matlab's support for RoboCup; (hard)
6. automatic referee. (hard)
7. enable adding and removing robot models. (hard)
8. Use a sdf element to determine our or opponent's Gazebo plugins instead of creating two almost-the-same plugin files. (nubot_gazebo.cc and rival_gazebo.cc) (easy)
9. Do not subscribe to the simulation information in the gazebo plugin; it is not necessary. (easy)
